   Assalamu Alykom,
- Thank you for using CSV_Dict.
- This Dictionary read csv files, with semicolon ";" delimiter "separated".
- you can put csv files in folders with this names "csv" or "csv_file", or put them in the same folder with "CSV_Dict" file.
- you can specify other paths for "csv files" by opening setting.json file then add your paths.
- you can search for a word or sentence (both languages), when you put space before or after the word the rusalt may change.
- if you want to change colors, font-size, background.........etc, open setting.json file and change whatever you want.
- you can change the language from "lang.json", let English sentences, you have to change Arabic sentences only. if you want English interface let the  quotation mark empty.
- from setting.json file you can change the styles as you want, and maybe you can add others, it's just a CSS stylesheet. But you don't have to change the names.
-from the following you can do:
    * "paths": add paths to a folders contain csv files.
    * "number_of_result": default max number of results.
    * "break": you can change the style and the character and the number of characters.
-the dictionary can run without lang.json, setting.json files but whitout styles.

How can I get CSV files?
========================

-from internt
-from Excel files (easy to change tp .csv).
-from .po .mo files, many applications use those files for translation specially on linux. 
-from any other files and database after editing, I used .xml, .db, .tmx
