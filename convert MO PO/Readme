if you want to get all .mo .po paths in a file run this two lines from terminal

$ locate "*.mo" > mo_file.txt

$ locate "*.po" > po_file.txt

I have tried the above two lines in Linux, if it doesn't work in Windows you have to do something else manually, apps like Everything is good for this.
 

if the letters of the target language are the same as the source, maybe you have to add the Abbreviation of the target language like, ar, en, ru, ko,......etc.


$ locate "*ar*.mo" > mo_file.txt

$ locate "*ar*.po" > po_file.txt

after you get the mo_file.txt and po_file.txt you have to run po2csv.py , mo2csv.py
you have to change some lines like: l_a, l_p (depends on target language)

you will have two files po.csv and mo.csv, and this is the database of CSV_Dict.

if the sizes of these files are big you can split them into small size files with this line (Linux)

$ split -l 10000 po.csv

10000 is the number of lines in one file (you can change the number)
